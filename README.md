📌 Project Overview:
This project analyzes data from a Portuguese banking institution’s direct marketing campaign, which aimed to persuade clients to subscribe to a term deposit product through phone calls. Using Excel, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and developed an interactive dashboard to uncover actionable insights that can guide future marketing efforts.

🎯 Objective:
Understand key factors influencing customer subscription.

Analyze the effectiveness of previous campaigns, contact methods, and customer demographics.

Build an insight-driven dashboard to present findings clearly and interactively.

🧰 Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting)

Observations: Each row represents a customer contacted during the campaign

Key Fields:
